# ML Learning Material

  
This guide is intended for anyone having zero or a small background in programming, maths, and machine learning. If you don't like reading books, skip it. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.

All resources listed here are free, except some online courses which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it can certainly be done without it with a little more reading and practice. <strong>We recommend you to not pay for any of the course. </strong>

Don't be afraid to repeat videos or learn from multiple sources. Repetition is the key of success to learning!

<strong> _Feel free to message us if there's any other great resources to add to this repository or regarding any doubts related to any material or concept_ </strong>

## No coding background, no problem we got you covered<a name="Coding"></a>
Here is a list of some great courses to learn the programming side of machine learning.

* [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/) - Free interactive tutorial to learn python
* [Learn Python Basics for Data Analysis](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/2304731-learn-python-basics-for-data-analysis/6009031-get-started-with-python-and-anaconda) - Free course on OpenClassrooms
* [Machine Learning with Python | Coursera - IBM](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=8jtkHPNI0iU&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fmachine-learning-with-python) - Optional (Paying)

# Follow these steps for the next few weeks until the review üëáüèΩ

## 1. Setup a Anaconda Environment, which will help you complete the coding tasks<a name="Env"></a>
You can refer this video to set an environment: [Setting up Conda Environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGaw6VXV3GI)

## 2. Start with the Andrew Ng Course on Coursera<a name="AndrewNG"></a>
### Complete the Week 1 and 2 of the Standford Course 

This is the best way to start from nothing. Understand the mathematics behind each algortihm nicely, as you will be facing exercises on each algorithm and will be instructed to write algorithms from scratch. 

* Introduction to the most used terms
    * [Learn the basics in a minute - What's AI](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO4GrDnQanVe6F6MRJg_KO7JEoH-ukFzY) - YouTube Playlist
* After watching a introductory video on commonly used terms of ML, complete the Andrew Ng course as instructed. 
    * [Andrew Ng Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=07-StanfordML-IN&utm_content=07-StanfordML-IN&campaignid=1950458127&adgroupid=70518019333&device=c&keyword=machine%20learning%20certification%20programs&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=351294690208&hide_mobile_promo)

## 3. Complete these coding task and build the algorithms from scratch<a name="Practice"></a>
 -  [Task 1](#)
 -  [Task 2](#)


## 4. After you are done with the coding task follow free online courses on YouTube<a name="YouTubeCourses"></a>

Here is a list of awesome courses available on YouTube that you should definitely follow and are 100% free.
